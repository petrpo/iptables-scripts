# iptables scripts

Can probably help with setting of iptables remotely and avoid a linux host locked and go to a console again

- 2016-03-19 first version

## files:
- iptables.rules.accept      ; allow all connections
- iptables.rules.drop        ; disable all connections
- iptables.rules.not-router  ; allow basic connections and not lock linux host 
- iptables.rules-router      ; linux as a router - still not done
