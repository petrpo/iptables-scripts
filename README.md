2016-03-19 iptables-scripts
 These scripts can help with setting of iptables remotely and
 avoid to have linux host locked and go to console
files:
- iptables.rules.accept      ; allow all connections
- iptables.rules.drop        ; disable all connections
- iptables.rules.not-router  ; allow basic connections and not lock linux host 
- iptables.rules-router      ; linux as a router - still not done
